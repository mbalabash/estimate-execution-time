## Estimo ![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/mbalabash/estimo.svg?branch=master) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mbalabash/estimo/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mbalabash/estimo/tree/master)

Estimo was created with idea in mind how to measure parse/compile/execution time for javascript libs.

It uses [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) to generate Chrome Timelines. Which can be transformed in human-readable format by [Tracium](https://github.com/aslushnikov/tracium).

**Keep in mind** there result depends on your device and available resources.

Inspired by [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit). Thanks [@ai](https://github.com/ai/) for support.

## Why?

JavaScript is the most expensive part of our frontend.

**We should** really care about [size](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/size-limit-make-the-web-lighter). But in additional to size, we also need to think about how long our JavaScript will process.

## Install

```js
npm i estimo
```

or

```js
yarn add estimo
```

## JS API

```js
const estimo = require('estimo')
const path = require('path')

;(async () => {
  const report = await estimo(path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, '..', 'libs', 'someLib.js')))
  console.log(report)
})()
```

## CLI

```sh
estimo -l ./libs/someLib.js
```

## Output

```json
[
  {
    "library": "someLib.js",
    "parseHTML": 1.62,
    "styleLayout": 54.98,
    "paintCompositeRender": 1.1,
    "scriptParseCompile": 1.16,
    "scriptEvaluation": 8.66,
    "javaScript": 9.82,
    "garbageCollection": 0,
    "other": 15.83,
    "total": 83.35
  }
]
```

## Multiple files

You can also pass few files and they will process in one Chrome instance.

```sh
estimo -l ./libs/someLib.js ./libs/myLib.js
```

```js
const report = await estimo(['/path/to/libs/someLib.js', '/path/to/libs/myLib.js'])
```

## HTML URLs

You can also pass URLs to HTML pages served over HTTP(S)

```sh
estimo -l http://localhost:8080/myLib.html
```

```js
const report = await estimo(['http://localhost:8080/myLib.html'])
```

## Time

**All metrics in milliseconds**.

We measure system-cpu time. The number of seconds that the process has spent on the CPU.

We not including time spent waiting for its turn on the CPU.

## Fields Description

- **library** - Library name.

- **parseHTML** - Time which was spent for `ParseHTML`, `ParseAuthorStyleSheet` events.

- **styleLayout** - Time which was spent for `ScheduleStyleRecalculation`, `UpdateLayoutTree`, `InvalidateLayout`, `Layout` events.

- **paintCompositeRender** - Time which was spent for `Animation`, `HitTest`, `PaintSetup`, `Paint`, `PaintImage`, `RasterTask`, `ScrollLayer`, `UpdateLayer`, `UpdateLayerTree`, `CompositeLayers` events.

- **scriptParseCompile** - Time which was spent for `v8.compile`, `v8.compileModule`, `v8.parseOnBackground` events.

- **scriptEvaluation** - Time which was spent for `EventDispatch`, `EvaluateScript`, `v8.evaluateModule`, `FunctionCall`, `TimerFire`, `FireIdleCallback`, `FireAnimationFrame`, `RunMicrotasks`, `V8.Execute` events.

- **javaScript** - Time which was spent for both event groups (**scriptParseCompile** and **scriptEvaluation**).

- **garbageCollection** - Time which was spent for `MinorGC`, `MajorGC`, `BlinkGC.AtomicPhase`, `ThreadState::performIdleLazySweep`, `ThreadState::completeSweep`, `BlinkGCMarking` events.

- **other** - Time which was spent for `MessageLoop::RunTask`, `TaskQueueManager::ProcessTaskFromWorkQueue`, `ThreadControllerImpl::DoWork` events.

- **total** - Total time.

## CPU Throttling Rate Options

The CPU Throttling Rate Emulation Options allow you to generate a Performance timeline under specified CPU conditions. To turn on CPU emulation, you must pass the **emulateCpuThrottling** flag along with additional configuration options.

- **emulateCpuThrottling** (optional; `false`) - This flag allows the other CPU Throttling Rate Options to be respected. They will be completely ignored unless this flag is set.

- **cpuThrottlingRate** (optional; `1`) - Sets the CPU throttling rate. The number represents the slowdown factor (e.g., 2 is a "2x" slowdown).

**JS API**:

```js
...
await estimo('/absolute/path/to/lib', {
  emulateCpuThrottling: true,
  cpuThrottlingRate: 4,
})
...
```

**CLI**:

```sh
estimo -l ./libs/someLib.js --cpu --cpuRate 4
```

## Network Emulation Options

The Network Emulation Options allow you to generate a Performance timeline under specified network conditions. To turn on network emulation, you must pass the **emulateNetworkConditions** flag along with additional configuration options.

- **emulateNetworkConditions** (optional; `false`) - This flag allows the other Network Emulation Options to be respected. They will be completely ignored unless this flag is set.

- **offline** (optional; `false`) - Passing the `offline` flag to the generate command emulate a network disconnect.

- **latency** (optional; `0`) - Artificial, minimum latency between request sent and response header received expressed in milliseconds (ms).

- **downloadThroughput** (optional: `0`) - The maximum download speed in megabits per second. `0` disables throttling.

- **uploadThroughput** (optional: `0`) - The maximum upload speed in megabits per second. `0` disables throttling.

- **connectionType** (optional: `none`) - A label of the supposed underlying network connection type that the browser is using. Supported values are documented under Chrome Headless' ConnectType documentation. Variants: `none`, `cellular2g`, `cellular3g`, `cellular4g`, `bluetooth`, `ethernet`, `wifi`, `wimax`, `other`.

**JS API**:

```js
...
await estimo('/absolute/path/to/lib', {
  emulateNetworkConditions: true,
  offline: false,
  latency: 150,
  downloadThroughput: 1.6,
  uploadThroughput: 0.75,
  connectionType: 'cellular3g',
})
...
```

**CLI**:

```sh
estimo -l ./libs/someLib.js --net --latency 150 --download 1.6 --upload 0.75 --connection cellular3g
```
